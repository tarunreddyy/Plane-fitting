# Least Squares Fit 3D Plane Python
This code provides three methods for fitting a plane to 3D point data:

- Standard least squares
- Total least squares
- RANSAC

The code includes a main function that loads point data from two .csv files and fits a plane using each method. The resulting planes are then plotted using Matplotlib.

## Dependencies
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Run the code: python3 plane_fitting.py
2. The output will show the fitted planes plotted using Matplotlib.
